Some of the tools here are useful, although mostly specific to my networks and configurations. But expect some crazy shit, too. One might discover three different implementations of an obscure protocol from 1980's or something just as useless.

## Things here

 * `cluenet/` - tools for the [Cluenet](http://cluenet.org/) network
 * `devel/` - not quite finished stuff
 * `dist/` - tools related to distribution of dotfiles and the like
 * `irc/` - IRC-related software
 * `irssi/` - scripts for the Irssi IRC client
 * `lib/` - libraries, modules, etc
 * `mail/` - stuff related to my email setup
 * `ssh/` - the SSH protocol
 * `useless/` - impossibly useless
 * `win32/`
    * `identd/` - Ident (RFC 1413) service

## Elsewhere

 * [`wtsmonitor`](https://gist.github.com/896881) - Terminal Services event monitor
 * [other repos](http://nullroute.eu.org/git/) - either very incomplete or just unworthy of Github
